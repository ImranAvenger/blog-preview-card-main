## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Through this project, I learned how to effectively use Tailwind CSS utility classes to build a responsive card component. I gained a better understanding of Flexbox for layout positioning and how to implement hover states for interactive elements. Working with custom spacing and shadows in Tailwind helped me create a polished, modern design that matches the provided mockup.

I also learned the importance of semantic HTML structure and how to organize utility classes for better readability and maintainability.

```html
<article class="bg-white rounded-lg shadow-lg p-6 hover:shadow-xl transition-shadow">
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Blog Title</h2>
</article>
```

### Continued development

I plan to explore more about Tailwind CSS by completing additional Frontend Mentor challenges. This will help me solidify my understanding of utility-first CSS and responsive design patterns. Once I feel confident with Tailwind, I'll move forward to learning React JS to build more dynamic and interactive web applications.
